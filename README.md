# Valorant-Anti-AFK

Mum told to go get groceries mid game? tired of AFK penalties? Use this script and prevent AFK Penalty.

Easy way to use this is run the .exe file on your computer. It will give warning for suspicious application as the script presses "A" key from the keyboard to prevent AFK every 1 second, but due to input lag of hardware, the pressing of A reflects after approximately 2 seconds.

or the hard way

Python Library requirements to run the script manually are, although preferred by those who have somewhat knowledge of python are:-

psautogui
pygetwindow
psutil
and a version of python 3.

to install the libraries, open CMD PROMPT and type pip install psutil psautogui pygetwindow

after the installation is complete, use CD command and navigate to the directory of Anti-AFK.py file and type "python Anti-AFK.py" the application will execute.
